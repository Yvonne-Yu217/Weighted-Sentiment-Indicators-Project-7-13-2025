# Weighted Sentiment Indicators Project

## Introduction

This project aims to construct weighted sentiment indicators by analyzing news text and image content. The entire process is executed through a series of Python scripts in sequential order, from data scraping, processing, and analysis to final regression modeling.

## Project Structure and Execution Order

The scripts in this project are designed to be executed sequentially. Please run the scripts in the following numerical order:

1.  `1sina_news_category_crawler.py`: Crawls news categories from Sina News.
2.  `2news_scraper.py`: Scrapes news content based on the categories.
3.  `3image_downlowder_final.py`: Downloads images from the news articles.
4.  `4image_basic_filter.py`: Performs a basic filtering of the downloaded images.
5.  `5text_analysis_helper.py`: Helper script for text analysis.
6.  `6clarity_analysis_helper.py`: Helper script for image clarity analysis.
7.  `7image_quality_processor.py`: Processes the quality of the images.
8.  `8image_duplicate_selector.py`: Selects images after deduplication.
9.  `9sentiment_analyzer.py`: Performs sentiment analysis.
10. `10calculate_daily_photopes_with_dedup.py`: Calculates daily image-based sentiment indicators with deduplication.
11. `11calculate_daily_textpes.py`: Calculates daily text-based sentiment indicators.
12. `12merge_and_process_data.py`: Merges and processes the generated data.
13. `13regresssion.py`: Performs regression analysis to build the final model.

## Dependencies

Before running the project, please ensure that all necessary Python libraries are installed. It is recommended to create a `requirements.txt` file to manage project dependencies.

## Other Scripts

- `delete_dot_underscore_files.py`: A utility script to delete `._` hidden files created by macOS when copying files to a non-HFS+ partition.
